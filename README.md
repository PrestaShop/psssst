# Psssst, the amazing PrestaShop module parser!

The idea behind this minimalist CLI application is to collect information about PrestaShop module.
One of the information that is really precious to me is the hooks available for a module.

This is why with this application you can retrieve the list of hooks for a module.

> For now, hooks dynamically dispatched in Smarty templates are not found.


## How to use it?

Really simple, only the module path is needed.

Alternatively, you can use `--export` option to retrieve results as JSON instead.
